        "1. I generate synthetic business and advertising data to simulate real-world customer interactions.\n"
        "2. I preprocess and normalize the data to compute key performance indicators such as website visits, email clicks, "
        "ad engagement, and conversion rates.\n"
        "3. I use a state-of-the-art Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) neural network built with PyTorch to score and generate strategies for each lead.\n"
        "4. I apply advanced analytics and clustering to segment the leads and extract actionable insights.\n"
        "5. I generate comprehensive reports, including a leads report, performance analytics, and a decision summary with recommendations.\n\n"
        "By combining these techniques, I help stakeholders optimize resource allocation, refine targeting, and ultimately boost sales.\n"
